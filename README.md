📌 Contributions

This project was built as part of a university group project. While collaboration was intended, I took ownership of the majority of the backend, including:

All backend integration

JWT Authentication system

Geolocation-based logic

Donation tracking and dashboard APIs

Food waste tracker (My Fridge component)

Frontend routing structure and some UI polishing

I also handled much of the deployment-ready structuring and cleanups for group-wide integration.

🔭 Future Improvements

Allow users to change address after registration.

Fix image upload functionality on listings.

Add donation history per user.

Improve responsive design and component polish.

E2E testing suite and backend validation enhancements.

🛠️ Tooling

Version control via Git

Deployed with GitHub Pages (frontend only preview, backend local/dev only)
